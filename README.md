# ECG signal seperation using independent component analysis
Small project from course on independent component analysis. 

Implementation of fastICA and PCA and AMUSE. The implementations were tested on real ECG data from a pregnant woman. Attempts were made to separate the small ECG signals from the fetus from the much stronger ones from the mother.
