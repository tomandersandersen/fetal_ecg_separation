# fetal_ecg_separation
Small project from course on independent component analysis. 

Implementation of fastICA and PCA and AMUSE. The implementations were tested on real ECG data from a pregnant woman. Attempts were made to separate the small ECG signals from the fetus from the much stronger ones from the mother.
